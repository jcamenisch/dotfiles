# Some param parsing helpers--to distinguish between params that start with a hyphen (-) and those that don't
# These are mainly used in the context of a shell function by passing $@ or $* to them.

# Return the params with dashes. E.g.:
#
#   $ get_dashful 1 -2 3 -4
#   -2
#   -4
get_dashful() {
  for thing in $@; do
    [[ $thing == -* ]] && echo "$thing"
  done
}

# Return the params without dashes. E.g.:
#
#   $ get_dashless 1 -2 3 -4
#   1
#   3
get_dashless() {
  for thing in $@; do
    [[ $thing == -* ]] || echo "$thing"
  done
}
